    <ul><h1>Human mission to Mars</h1></ul>

        <ul><p>
            A human mission to Mars has been the subject of science fiction since the 1880s, and of</br> 
            aerospace engineering and scientific proposals <b>since the late 1940s</b>. Plans include landing </br> on Mars for exploration at a minimum, with some considering exploring its moons Phobos <br>
            and Deimos. Longterm proposals have included sending settlers and starting terraforming of <br>
            the planet.

                The exploration of Mars has been a goal of national space programs for decades. <br>
                Conceptual work for missions that would involve human explorers has been ongoing since <br>
                <b>the 1950s</b>, with planned missions typically being stated as taking place anywhere between <br>
                10 and 30 years from the time they are drafted.The list of <b>crewed</b> Mars mission plans shows <br>
                the various mission proposals that have been put forth by multiple organizations and space <br>
                agencies in this field of space exploration. Plans have varied from scientific expeditions, in <br>
                which a small group (between two and eight astronauts) would visit Mars for a period of a <br>
                few weeks or year, to a continuous presence (e.g. through research stations, colonization or <br>
                other continuous humanization).[citation needed] Virtual visits to Mars, using haptic <br>
                technologies, have also been proposed.[ <br>
                <i>In the 2010s</i>, numerous US, European, and Asian agencies were developing proposals for <br>
                human missions to Mars.[citation needed] In fiction, Mars is a frequent target of exploration <br>
                and settlement in books, graphic novels, and films. <br>
